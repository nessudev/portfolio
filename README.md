# Portfolio

This is a project of my portfolio website.
I designed the website layout first with Figma. The website is done using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

## Design of the portfolio

### Home
First when you open the porfolio website, you get to the home page.
The purpose of the home page is to welcome the user and tell what is the purpose of the website.

In the projects tab, there are highlighted a few projects which you can click on to further inspect them, if you're interested.

## On mobile
When the screen size is smaller, the nav bar links get behind a toggle button, which you click and it will show you all the page links.
Here is a simple description of the user flow:
